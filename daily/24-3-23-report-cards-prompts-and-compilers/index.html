This could work in school, but as you move to college to study something like electrical engineering, coasting through courses and getting good grades would need more than just nerd energy.\nI had okay grades with little hard work during my undergrad, but I spent a lot of time and effort to get good grades and graduate during my postgrad.\nI still rely on the nerd energy to work.
